Description: This package provides a consistent set of palettes, all based on
    the ColorBrewer Spectral palette, as approximated in hcl space by the recent 
    colorspace package. The different palettes and corresponding ggplot2 scales
    should be able to handle most use cases for continuous and discrete scales,
    including sequential, diverging and qualitative palettes, with single or
    double hue gradients. Moreover, they all have been checked with respect
    to the different types of CVD, and should behave reasonably well for most
    people.
